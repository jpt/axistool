# axistool

axistool is a tool for axis interpolation and building avar tables inside glyphsapp.

# acknowledgements

axistool ports linus romer's [stepinterpolation](https://github.com/linusromer/stepinterpolation) repo from java to python. stepinterpolation is a generalization of [luc(as) de groot's interpolation theory](https://www.lucasfonts.com/learn/interpolation-theory). see [the typedrawers thread](https://typedrawers.com/discussion/2665/a-generalization-of-lucas-de-groot-s-interpolation-theory) for an explanation.

# TODO

- actually make the UI lmao
- get this working using glyphs3 api (this runs in glyphs3 right now, but applying the axes should consider the API)
